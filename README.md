# Orthogonal Range Searching and K-D Tree

## Getting Started 

Make sure you have python 3.11+ Installed. No other packages are required. 

Please ensure that employees.csv is in the same file as the program. 
This code builds a K-D tree based on the data from employees.csv from there you can enter a range and the software will return the points within that range.

There are two ways to run this algorithm either by the default implementation or with a custom range \
With the custom range please enter four values two for the x values and two for the y values. 

### Running the tests
You can run the tests with the following in the same directory as the code 
```python -m unittest``` 

### Running the code
Run this command in the same directory as main.py
```python main.py```
